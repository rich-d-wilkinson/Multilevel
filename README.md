# Multilevel/multifidelity working group

List of key papers, in an approximate suggested reading order (within each category).

### Multilevel Monte Carlo
- [Multilevel Monte Carlo methods](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/gilesm/files/acta15.pdf) by Giles, 2015.


### Multifidelity
- [Optimal Model Management for Multifidelity Monte Carlo Estimation](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/15M1046472) by Peherstorfer, Willcox, and Gunzburger, 2016.

We held a reading group on this paper. To start the discussion on compariing MLMC and MFMC with ML-emulation, we implemented MFMC with the surrogate being a GP emulator. You can see this in the notebook [here](https://github.com/rich-d-wilkinson/Multilevel/blob/master/Multi-fidelityGPonline.ipynb).

We describe an approach, termed reified analysis, for linking the behaviour of mathematical models with inferences about the physical systems which the models represent. We describe the logical basis for the approach, based on coherent assessment of the
